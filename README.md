The methods.py module we constructed contains a class built to help users analyzize data on agrcultural total factor productivity providing tools for:
- Downloading the file 
- Reading the CSV and Turning it into a Pandas dataframe 
- Anaylzing the available data using methods such as gapminders and correlation matrices to observe differences in outputs 

The notebook Storytelling.ipynb provides a showcase of how the Agros_class from the methods module can be used to analyse the USDAâ€™s Agricultural total factor productivity data. We use our created class to preform some simple data analysis to further showcase our methods. 

## HOW TO USE THE Agros_class 

To use the class call the following code: _from methods import Agros_class_ 

To initiate the class simply create a variable such as: _your_variable=Agros_class()_

You are now able to use the methods created and described in methods.py:
download_file()
read_data()
get_countries()
plot_quantity_correlation()
plot_output_area_chart()
gapminder()

This project was carried out for the Advanced Programming for Data Science course at Nova SBE.
