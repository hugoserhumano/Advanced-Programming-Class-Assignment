2612 Advanced Programming for Data Science 2022/2023

The current repository serves for the collection of methods and material for a project that aims at gaining valuable insight from agricultural output for various countries in order to contribute to green energy transition. This repository contains methods that allow for analysis of data containing variables that determine agricultural total factor productivity. 

To get hands on with the project, download the showcase notebook which can then be run and readapted to fit the user’s analytical goal. The Showcase notebook can serve to the analysis the USDA’s Agricultural total factor productivity data. We use the class Agros_class to perform methods that allow for further insight to the user of the data. The analysis can be readapted to other countries by changing the variable names.

For additional information on the code structure and how to use it, refer to the prototype notebook repository which will have a file of the detailed code.
